# respeaker-whisper-pi-recomputer-hailo
This project runs OpenAI Whisper speech-to-text on a reComputer or Raspberry Pi 5 with ReSpeaker microphone input. Transcribed text is sent over UDP to a Node-RED flow, where it is processed and displayed in a real-time interactive dashboard. Ideal for edge AI voice interfaces and IoT control panels.
